At 5:38 PM Central time tonight, Sanctuary Crew member Sean "Tenkou" Neese passed away of septicemia.

On Tuesday morning, he woke with weakness and slurred speech, and his roommate called 911 immediately. It was already too late. A valiant effort was made by the doctors and nurses, but his condition did not improve over the next day and there was nothing more that could be done.

He is survived only by his found families- the one he'd been adopted into, and the few online communities he frequented. He will be missed, greatly, by all of us.
