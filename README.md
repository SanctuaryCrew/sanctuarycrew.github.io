# sanctuarycrew.github.io

Welcome to the live repository that generates the www.sanctuarycrew.com website! Keep in mind that any commits you do to this repository go live *pretty much immediately*. I suggest you use "Run Hugo Server" to test out your changes before you push any updates.

## Requirements

You'll need to get [Hugo Extended](https://gohugo.io/installation/windows/) if you don't already have it. There is also a Visual Studio Code profile for those who wish to use that for their writing. That profile includes a task for generating new content.

## Running into problems?

Contact *'that man'* who most certainly will be able to help you, if you can find him.
